# Readout

### v1.0.0

## Introduction

Readout is a monospaced display font inspired by the 16-segment LED numeric displays that became popular in the 1980s and 1990s.

## Glyphs

This font was designed primarily as an alphanumeric display font. Aside from a very limited set of punctuation marks (which are often represented separately from the 7 numerical segments in common physical implementations of an LED display), no attempt has been made to alter the segments in any one glyph to make a representation of that glyph possible or more readable. Readout stays within the bounds of what would have been possible with a typical 16-segment LED display.

In addition to numbers, glyphs have been included for the Latin alphabet (English), both upper and lower case where possible within the constraints imposed by a 16-segment display. Where only upper or lower case is possible, both upper case and lower case will render the same glyph.

In addition to the alphanumeric and aforementioned punctuation characters, there are a few symbols that are commonly used with numeric displays. Future versions may include more symbols. See the included glyphs .png file for all of the included glyphs.

## Installation

Readout is packaged as a .ttf file, so it can be installed or used in an application. Use in an app will vary depending on the technologies that you are using to build the app.
